## Day 2 – Terminal, OS & Developer Environment

### Topics
- Terminal fundamentals and Linux basics
- File and folder operations
- Process and port management
- Environment variables and PATH
- Package managers (pip, npm)
- Git fundamentals and version control

### Common Commands
```bash
pwd
ls -la
cd
mkdir
touch
rm
rm -rf
ps aux
kill -9 PID
lsof -i :3000
git init
git add .
git commit -m "message"
```

### Outcome
